# Time-Tracking-Reminder
Requirement:

This project is used to create an APP( Android only) used to remind me to calculate the working hours of the month
in APP before the deadline of wage settlement, of course the calculation will be done automatically in APP; And it can record the 
hours per day you engaged in each project, which can help the manager to evaluate the expense of the project as well as personal
bonus.

Background:

Usually we have the SAP system to automatically calculate the working hours if you use the company' s ID card to punch in
and punch out during the day. Then, if the calculated result from SAP is smaller than your planned 
working hours, your salary of the month will be deducted:-(
However there might be some mismatches between the SAP's calc result and your actuals due to the following situation:
We have some shortfall in the past due to bad economics, we have to work overtime to offset that. Your overtime which is used
to offset will NOT be accounted in SAP system, so the SAP's calc result might be smaller than the planned of the month, especially
when you have the advanced compensated leave.
